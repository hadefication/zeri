# Feature Specification: Add Development.md Instructions for Specs

## Overview
Enhance the generated development.md file to include instructions for working with specifications when using `zeri add-spec`. This will provide clear guidance to developers on how to properly create and manage specifications in the `.zeri/specs/` directory.

## Requirements
- Add a new section in the generated development.md with instructions for creating specifications
- Include guidance on using `zeri add-spec <name>` command
- Explain the specification workflow and best practices
- Reference the importance of TODO marking as mentioned in existing development practices
- Integrate seamlessly with existing development.md structure and content

## Implementation Notes
- The instructions should be added to the development.md template or generator
- Need to identify where in the development.md structure this section belongs (likely near the end or in a dedicated "Specifications" section)
- Should maintain consistency with existing documentation style and formatting
- Must reference the `.zeri/specs/` directory structure
- Should include examples of good specification practices

## Example Content Structure
The new section should include:
- How to create a new specification using `zeri add-spec`
- Purpose and structure of specification files
- Workflow for implementing features from specifications
- Importance of marking TODOs as complete during implementation
- Best practices for specification content

## TODO
- [x] Design and plan implementation
- [x] Locate development.md template/generator
- [x] Design the new instructions section content
- [x] Implement the enhancement
- [x] Test the changes
- [x] Update related documentation if needed
- [x] Mark specification as complete
