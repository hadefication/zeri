# Feature Specification: fix-gemini-import-warnings

## Overview
Fix the import processor warnings in the Gemini generator that occur when attempting to import .md files. The warnings indicate that the import processor only supports .md files but is receiving file references with .md extensions in the link format [file.md](file.md), which it's interpreting as non-md files.

## Requirements
- Fix the import processor warnings for .zeri/project.md and .zeri/development.md references
- Ensure Gemini generator properly handles file imports without warnings
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Gemini file generation
- Fix both the stub template and any existing generated files

## Implementation Notes
- Issue is in the Gemini stub file and generated GEMINI.md files
- The problem appears to be with the file reference format in the import statements
- Need to examine the Gemini generator and stub template to identify the incorrect import syntax
- May need to update the import format from `[file.md](file.md)` to a supported format
- Should test the fix by generating a new Gemini file and verifying no warnings occur

## TODO

- [x] Implement core functionality
- [x] Add tests
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Review and refine
- [x] Mark specification as complete
