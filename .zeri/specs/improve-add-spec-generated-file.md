# Feature Specification: improve-add-spec-generated-file

## Overview
Revamp the add-spec command to generate lean, focused specification files with a TODO section that can be marked as complete by AI assistants once implemented. The current template is too verbose and contains many irrelevant sections for most features.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want specification files to be concise and focused on essential information
- As an AI assistant, I want a clear TODO section to track implementation progress
- As a developer, I want to avoid manually removing irrelevant template sections
- As a team lead, I want specifications that are easy to review and understand

## Functional Requirements
- Generate lean specification templates with only essential sections
- Include a TODO section with checkboxes for implementation tracking
- Remove verbose template sections that aren't commonly used
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing specifications
- Allow customization through the template system

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: File generation should complete in < 100ms
- Maintainability: Template should be easy to modify
- Usability: Generated files should require minimal editing

## API Specifications
No API changes required - this is a template and command modification.

## Database Changes
No database changes required.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Command output should be clean and informative
- Generated specification should be immediately usable
- TODO section should use markdown checkboxes for AI implementation tracking

## Security Considerations
No security implications - this is a local file generation feature.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for AddSpecCommand with new template
- Integration tests for file generation
- Test that existing specifications are not affected
- Verify TODO section format is correct

## Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Update spec.md template to lean format with TODO section
Phase 2: Modify AddSpecCommand to use simplified replacements
Phase 3: Test and validate the new format
Phase 4: Update documentation

## TODO
- [x] Update .zeri/templates/spec.md with lean format
- [x] Add TODO section with implementation checkboxes
- [x] Modify AddSpecCommand to use simplified placeholders
- [x] Remove unnecessary interactive prompts (kept essential overview prompt)
- [x] Test file generation with new template
- [x] Update DEVELOPMENT.md documentation
- [x] Mark this specification as complete
