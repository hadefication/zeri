# Feature Specification: improve-add-spec-generated-file

## Overview
Revamp the add-spec command to generate lean, focused specification files with a TODO section that can be marked as complete by AI assistants once implemented. Replace verbose template with essential sections only.

## Requirements
- Generate lean specification templates with only essential sections (Overview, Requirements, Implementation Notes, TODO)
- Include TODO section with checkboxes for implementation tracking by AI assistants
- Remove verbose template sections that aren't commonly used (API specs, database changes, UI/UX, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing specifications
- Update both stub template and InitCommand to use new format
- Allow customization through the template system

## Implementation Notes
- Need to update stubs/templates/spec.md.stub with lean format
- Need to update InitCommand placeholder mappings to match new template
- AddSpecCommand already updated with new replacements
- TODO section purpose is for AI usage tracking and progress management
- Template uses {{PLACEHOLDER}} format for consistency

## TODO
- [x] Design and plan implementation
- [x] Implement core functionality (stub template + InitCommand updates)
- [x] Add tests (manual testing completed)
- [x] Update documentation (DEVELOPMENT.md updated)
- [x] Review and refine (completed and tested)
- [x] Mark specification as complete
